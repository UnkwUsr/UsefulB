# UsefulB - Useful Break
With prolonged work at the computer, you may need a break to distract from work, go for a drink of water, give your eyes a rest, etc. I suggest you solve "easy" tasks: train your brain, learn to something... Also, in this way you will switch for a new problem, so after break you can continue work with a fresh mind.

# Installation
*not yet provided, but you can just start program from project folder with comand line: `python src/main.py`*

# Inspiration
* [SafeEyes] - eye protection break reminder
